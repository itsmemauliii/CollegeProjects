## âœ… Key Concepts Learned

### 1. ðŸ”¢ Probability Experiments
- Understanding outcomes of random experiments
- Simulating dice rolls
- Visualizing outcome frequencies

### 2. ðŸ“Š Probability Distributions
- Generating and analyzing normal distribution samples
- Understanding mean, variance, skewness
- Visualizing with histograms

### 3. ðŸ”„ Stochastic Processes
- Introduction to Poisson process
- Simulating random event counts over time
- Plotting event timelines

### 4. ðŸ•’ Time Series Modeling
- Simulating trend and seasonal components
- Creating synthetic time series data
- Plotting and interpreting patterns

## ðŸ§ª Practice Projects
- **probability_experiment.csv** + `probability_experiment.R`: Die roll simulation and visualization
- **distribution_sample.csv** + `distribution_sample.R`: Distribution analysis
- **stochastic_process.csv** + `stochastic_process.R`: Simulated Poisson process
- **time_series_model.csv** + `time_series_model.R`: Trend & seasonal time series simulation

This subject helped me strengthen my foundation in probabilistic modeling, simulation, and statistical thinking â€“ key for any aspiring data scientist.
