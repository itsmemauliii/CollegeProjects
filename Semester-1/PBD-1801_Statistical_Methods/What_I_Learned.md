- Measures of dispersion: range, IQR, variance, standard deviation
- Skewness & kurtosis analysis

### 3. 🔄 Correlation & Regression
- Pearson and Spearman correlation
- Simple linear regression using R
- Scatter plots and residual analysis

### 4. 📊 Categorical Data Analysis
- Two-way contingency tables
- Chi-square tests for independence
- Association measures

### 5. 🕒 Introduction to Time Series
- Components: trend, seasonality, cyclic, random
- Time series decomposition
- Stationarity & autocorrelation
- Basic smoothing techniques
