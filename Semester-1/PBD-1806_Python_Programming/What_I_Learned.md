## 🧠 Key Learnings

### 🔹 Python Basics
- Data types: int, float, str, list, tuple, dict, set
- Control flow: `if`, `else`, `elif`, `while`, `for`
- Type casting and input/output functions
- String operations and formatting

### 🔹 Functions
- Defined reusable functions using `def`
- Used parameters and return values effectively
- Explored lambda (anonymous) functions
- Practiced recursion and scope management

### 🔹 File Handling
- Opened, read, wrote, and appended to text files
- Used file modes: `'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`, `'r+'`
- Managed file pointers and directories
- Implemented mini projects with persistent file storage

### 🔹 Packages & Modules
- Imported built-in modules: `math`, `random`, `os`, `datetime`
- Installed external libraries using `pip`
- Created and used custom Python modules

### 🔹 Exception Handling
- Handled runtime errors using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally`
- Caught specific exceptions like `ValueError`, `FileNotFoundError`
- Created custom (user-defined) exceptions
- Built more robust and crash-resistant programs

### 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Created classes and objects
- Used `__init__()` constructor method
- Implemented inheritance and method overriding
- Practiced encapsulation and polymorphism
